  ## Description
  This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) text editor built using CodeMirror as the editor library and IndexedDB for data persistence. The app supports offline access and can be installed on any device as a standalone app.


  ## Installation
  To get started with the PWA Text Editor, simply visit the live demo in your web browser. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the app locally on your machine.


  ## Usage
  Once you have the app up and running, you can start editing your text files right away. The app will automatically save your changes to IndexedDB and synchronize them with the server when online. You can also customize the theme and syntax mode to suit your needs.

To install the app on your device, simply click the install button in your browser's address bar. The app will then be installed as a standalone app, with its own icon and launch screen.
